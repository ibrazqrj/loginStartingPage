# loginStartingPage

## Overview

This project is a collaborative effort between [@keiwsh](https://www.github.com/keiwsh) and [@ibrazqrj](https://www.github.com/ibrazqrj) to create a login page using only HTML and CSS. 

The inspiration behind the design was drawn from simple smartphone login pages and generic social media login interfaces. We aimed to create a minimalist yet functional login experience.

## Color Selection

We utilized [UIColors.app](https://www.uicolors.app/) to aid in the color selection process. This tool allowed us to pick cohesive colors and ensure consistency across different elements of the login page. By matching colors carefully, we aimed to create a visually pleasing and harmonious design.

## Collaboration with VSCode Live Share

We leveraged the power of [VSCode's Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) for real-time collaboration during the development process. This allowed us to code together seamlessly, even when physically apart. With Live Share, we could simultaneously edit code, debug, and brainstorm ideas, enhancing productivity and fostering collaboration.

## Features

- **HTML & CSS**: The login page is built entirely using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. This ensures simplicity and ease of understanding, making it accessible for beginners.
- **Minimalist Design**: Inspired by smartphone login interfaces, the design follows a minimalist approach, focusing on essential elements for a clean and intuitive user experience.
